This is a repository to track and share my screenplays as fountain files.
I have started writing sketches for film and theater.
In addition, I have been using the fountain screenplay file syntax to format chatgpt output for a more visualizable learning experience.

Contemplating open sourced authorship, submit a pull request and we can discuss accreditation.
