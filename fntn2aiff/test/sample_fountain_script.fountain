Title: Sample Fountain Script

INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY

JAMES, a young man in his 20s, sits on the couch, watching TV. SARAH, his roommate, enters the room.

SARAH
What are you watching?

JAMES
Just some documentary about the environment.

SARAH
Sounds interesting.

JAMES
It is. It's showing the impact of climate change on polar bears.

SARAH
That's sad. We should do something to help.

JAMES
Agreed. Let's research ways to reduce our carbon footprint.

EXT. PARK - DAY

James and Sarah are walking in the park, discussing their plans to go green.

SARAH
I think we should start by using public transportation more often.

JAMES
Good idea. And we can also try to reduce our use of plastic.

SARAH
Definitely. Small changes can make a big difference.
