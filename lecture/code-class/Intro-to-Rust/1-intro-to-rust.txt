Lesson 1: Introduction to Rust

Overview of Rust
Rust is a systems programming language that aims to guarantee memory safety, thread safety, and high performance. It achieves this by focusing on zero-cost abstractions, ownership, and a strong type system. Developed by Mozilla Research, Rust has gained popularity for its safety features, which help developers avoid common programming errors, such as null pointer dereferences, buffer overflows, and data races.

Rust's Design Goals and Unique Features
Some of the key design goals and features of Rust include:

Memory safety without garbage collection: Rust ensures memory safety through its ownership system, which enforces strict rules on accessing and modifying memory.
Concurrency without data races: Rust provides concurrency constructs that prevent data races, enabling developers to write concurrent code more confidently.
Zero-cost abstractions: Rust's abstractions, such as traits and generics, allow for expressive and reusable code without incurring runtime overhead.
C-compatible FFI: Rust provides an easy and safe way to interoperate with C code, making it a suitable choice for embedding or extending existing C-based systems.
Setting up a Rust Development Environment
To set up a Rust development environment, follow these steps:

Install Rust: Download and run the rustup-init executable from the official Rust website (https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install). Follow the on-screen instructions to install Rust and its package manager, Cargo.

Choose an IDE or text editor: There are several options for Rust development, including Visual Studio Code with the Rust extension (rust-analyzer), IntelliJ IDEA with the Rust plugin, or a text editor like Vim or Emacs with Rust syntax support.

Configure your environment: Ensure that Rust and Cargo are in your system's PATH variable. This allows you to run Rust and Cargo commands from the command line.

Basic Syntax and Hello World Program

Here's a brief overview of Rust's syntax, followed by a simple "Hello, World!" program.

Comments: Rust supports line comments (//) and block comments (/* */).
Variables: Variables are immutable by default and are declared with the let keyword. To make a variable mutable, use let mut.
Functions: Functions are declared with the fn keyword, followed by the function name, parameter list, return type, and function body.
Control structures: Rust supports common control structures like if, else, loop, while, and for.
Example: Hello, World!

    // This is a single-line comment.

    /* This is a
      multi-line comment. */

    // Import the standard library's I/O module.
    use std::io;

    // Define the main function.
    fn main() {
        // Print "Hello, World!" to the console.
        println!("Hello, World!");

        // Get user input.
        let mut name = String::new();
        println!("What's your name?");
        io::stdin().read_line(&mut name).expect("Failed to read input");

        // Greet the user.
        println!("Hello, {}!", name.trim());
    }

To compile and run the program, save it as hello.rs and execute the following commands:

    $ rustc hello.rs
    $ ./hello

This lesson serves as a brief introduction to Rust, focusing on its goals, features, and basic syntax. In the following lessons, we will explore Rust's unique ownership system, error handling, data structures, and more.
