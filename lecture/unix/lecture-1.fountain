INT. CIA CLASSROOM - DAY

A group of young CIA recruits sit in a classroom, eagerly awaiting the start of their course on Unix systems. Professor BARAK MIZRAHI enters the room, carrying a MacBook laptop and a notepad.

PROFESSOR MIZRAHI
Good morning, recruits. My name is Professor Barak Mizrahi, and I will be your instructor for this course on Unix systems.

Mizrahi clears his throat.

PROFESSOR MIZRAHI
Before we begin, I would like to give you a brief overview of my background. I am a network administrator and computer science professor at MIT. However, what most people do not know is that I was once an infiltration engineer for the Israeli Defense Forces.

The recruits look at each other, surprised.

PROFESSOR MIZRAHI
As a child, I was always interested in computer systems and frequently got in trouble for exploiting vulnerabilities in the network on the military base where I grew up. The government eventually turned me from the line of command to use my talents, and I became the most effective hacker of my generation.

Mizrahi pauses for a moment before continuing.

PROFESSOR MIZRAHI
When I considered my debts to my country fulfilled, I became a professor at MIT, in an attempt to rekindle the curiosity I felt in my youth. Due to recent political unrest between the United States and China, the CIA has approached me to offer insight to their agents.

Mizrahi opens his laptop and begins to speak.

PROFESSOR MIZRAHI
Now, let's get started with our first lecture on Unix systems and the command line interface.

PROFESSOR MIZRAHI
Unix is a family of multitasking, multiuser operating systems that are widely used in servers, desktops, and mobile devices. Unix systems have a rich history, dating back to the 1960s, and have been the foundation for the development of many modern operating systems.

Mizrahi walks around the classroom, pointing to the whiteboard as he speaks.

PROFESSOR MIZRAHI
One of the key features of Unix is the command line interface, which allows you to interact with the operating system using a series of commands. This can be much faster and more powerful than using a graphical user interface, and it's a skill that's essential for any software engineer or network administrator.

Mizrahi turns to face the class.

PROFESSOR MIZRAHI
In this lecture, we will cover the basic Unix commands, the file system organization, and introduce you to text editors such as nVim. We will also cover customizing the Unix environment to suit your needs.

Mizrahi pulls up a terminal window on his laptop and begins to type.

PROFESSOR MIZRAHI
Let's start with some basic Unix commands. The first one we'll cover is 'ls', which is used to list the contents of a directory.

Mizrahi continues to type as the recruits follow along, taking notes and asking questions.

PROFESSOR MIZRAHI
Now that we've covered the basics of Unix and the command line interface, let's move on to file system organization. In Unix, everything is organized into a hierarchical file system, with the root directory at the top of the hierarchy.

Mizrahi draws a diagram of the file system hierarchy on the whiteboard.

PROFESSOR MIZRAHI
Each directory can contain files and other directories, and you can navigate through the file system using commands like 'cd' and 'pwd'.

Mizrahi opens a terminal window on his laptop and demonstrates how to navigate through the file system using the 'cd' and 'pwd' commands.

PROFESSOR MIZRAHI
Now, let's talk about text editors. In Unix, there are many powerful text editors available, such as nVim, emacs, and vi. These editors allow you to create and edit text files, and they can be customized to suit your needs.

PROFESSOR MIZRAHI
Now, let's open nVim and create a new text file. Type 'nvim' in the terminal to open nVim.

Mizrahi types 'nvim' in the terminal, and nVim opens on his laptop.

PROFESSOR MIZRAHI
Now, let's create a new file. Type ':new' in nVim to create a new buffer.

Mizrahi types ':new' in nVim, and a new buffer opens.

PROFESSOR MIZRAHI
You can now type whatever you want in this buffer. Let's add some text. Type 'This is a test' in the buffer.

Mizrahi types 'This is a test' in the buffer.

PROFESSOR MIZRAHI
Now, let's save the file. Type ':w test.txt' in nVim to save the buffer to a file called 'test.txt'.

Mizrahi types ':w test.txt' in nVim, and the buffer is saved to a file called 'test.txt'.

PROFESSOR MIZRAHI
You can now exit nVim by typing ':q'. Congratulations, you've just created and edited a text file using nVim.

PROFESSOR MIZRAHI
Finally, let's talk about customizing the Unix environment. You can customize your Unix environment in many ways, such as by setting environment variables, creating aliases, and customizing your shell prompt.

PROFESSOR MIZRAHI
Now, let's talk about customizing the Unix environment. You can customize your Unix environment in many ways, such as by setting environment variables, creating aliases, and customizing your shell prompt.

Mizrahi opens a terminal window on his laptop.

PROFESSOR MIZRAHI
Let's start with setting environment variables. Environment variables are variables that are used by programs to determine settings and behavior. You can set environment variables using the 'export' command.

Mizrahi demonstrates by setting an environment variable called 'MY_VAR' to 'Hello World'.

PROFESSOR MIZRAHI
To set an environment variable, simply type 'export VARIABLE_NAME=VALUE' in the terminal. For example, to set the variable 'MY_VAR' to 'Hello World', you would type 'export MY_VAR="Hello World"'.

The recruits follow along, setting their own environment variables.

PROFESSOR MIZRAHI
Now, let's talk about aliases. Aliases are shortcuts for frequently used commands. You can create aliases using the 'alias' command.

Mizrahi demonstrates by creating an alias for the 'ls' command called 'l'.

PROFESSOR MIZRAHI
To create an alias, simply type 'alias ALIAS_NAME=COMMAND' in the terminal. For example, to create an alias for the 'ls' command called 'l', you would type 'alias l="ls"'.

The recruits follow along, creating their own aliases.

PROFESSOR MIZRAHI
That's it for customizing the Unix environment using the 'export' and 'alias' commands. Remember to experiment and find what works best for you.

PROFESSOR MIZRAHI
For your assignment, I want you to practice what we've learned today. I want you to create a text file using nVim, save it to your home directory, and set an environment variable called 'MY_NAME' to your name. Then, I want you to create an alias for the 'ls' command called 'll'. Finally, I want you to take a screenshot of your terminal window showing the text file, environment variable, and alias, and email it to me before the end of the next lecture.

The recruits take notes, preparing to complete their assignment.

PROFESSOR MIZRAHI
You have three hours to complete this assignment, so don't procrastinate. Remember to practice what you've learned and don't be afraid to experiment.

The recruits thank Mizrahi and begin to work on their assignments.

FADE OUT.
