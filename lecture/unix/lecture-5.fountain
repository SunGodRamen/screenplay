INT. CIA CLASSROOM - DAY

Mizrahi stands at the front of the classroom, ready to begin his lecture on process management and scheduling.

PROFESSOR MIZRAHI
Good morning, everyone. Today, we'll be talking about process management and scheduling.

PROFESSOR MIZRAHI
A process is an instance of a program that is executing. Each process has its own memory space and resources. Threads are units of execution within a process that share the same memory space and resources.

PROFESSOR MIZRAHI
A process goes through several stages during its lifecycle. It starts in the "created" state, then moves to "ready" when it is waiting to be scheduled for execution. When the process is running, it is in the "running" state. Finally, when the process has completed its task, it moves to the "terminated" state.

PROFESSOR MIZRAHI
There are several process scheduling algorithms, including First-Come-First-Serve, Round Robin, and Priority-based scheduling. Each algorithm has its own strengths and weaknesses, and the choice of algorithm depends on the specific requirements of the system.

PROFESSOR MIZRAHI
Processes can be assigned priorities that determine how much CPU time they are given. This can help ensure that critical processes receive the resources they need to execute efficiently.

Mizrahi looks at the class.

PROFESSOR MIZRAHI
That concludes our lecture for today. Please review the material and be ready for our next class.

PROFESSOR MIZRAHI
Interprocess communication, or IPC, refers to the ways in which processes can communicate with each other. There are several mechanisms for IPC, including signals, pipes, sockets, and shared memory.

PROFESSOR MIZRAHI
Signals are a way for a process to communicate with another process or with the operating system. Signals can be used to request certain actions, such as terminating a process or pausing execution.

PROFESSOR MIZRAHI
Signal handling refers to the process of intercepting and handling signals. Some common signals include SIGINT, which is sent to terminate a process when the user presses Ctrl-C, and SIGKILL, which is used to forcefully terminate a process.

PROFESSOR MIZRAHI
Pipes are a way for processes to communicate by sending data between them. They are a unidirectional method of communication, with one process writing to the pipe and another process reading from it.

PROFESSOR MIZRAHI
Sockets are similar to pipes, but they provide bidirectional communication between processes. They are commonly used for network communication.

PROFESSOR MIZRAHI
Shared memory allows processes to share memory space, which can be more efficient than copying data between processes. However, it can also lead to synchronization issues and must be used carefully.

PROFESSOR MIZRAHI
I want you all to write a shell script that creates multiple child processes, each with a different priority level. The parent process should use a scheduling algorithm of your choice to manage the child processes.

He pauses to let the students write that down.

PROFESSOR MIZRAHI
Next, I want you to modify your shell script to include interprocess communication between the child processes. You can use either pipes, sockets, or shared memory to achieve this.

The students begin scribbling down notes.

PROFESSOR MIZRAHI
And finally, I want you to use signals to handle any errors that might arise during the process management and interprocess communication.

He looks around the room to make sure everyone is paying attention.

PROFESSOR MIZRAHI
Alright, you have three hours to complete the assignment. I suggest you start now.

FADE OUT.
