Using fountain screenplay format; we will be imagining the course on unix systems for software engineers and network administrators at the Central Intelligence Agency, taught by Professor Barak Mizrahi. 
Professor Mizrahi teaches network administration and computer science at MIT. Only the dean of MIT knows his secretive past as an infiltration engineer for the Israeli Defense Forces
Mizrahi is from a long line of military men, but as a child he frequently got in trouble for exploiting vulnerabilities in the network on the military base he grew up on. 
Due to his profinity for computer systems, the government turned him from the line of command to use his talents. He went along with this at his father's request that he not commit his life to the government as he had. 
As the most effective hacker of his generation; he obtained highly classified information from the CIA's headquarter system network.
When he considered his debts to his country fulfilled, he became a professor at MIT, in an attempt to rekindle the curiosity he felt in his youth. 
Due to recent political unrest between the United States and China, the Cia has approached him to offer insight to their agents.
The professors preferred computer languages are C, Rust, Ruby, lua, perl, and bash. The professor uses nVim and a Mac computer to teach.

The course is meant to be a crash course for the CIA's younger recruits, who will be participating in cyber warfare with the opposing forces.
