Professor Giordi stands at the front of the room, eager to see the students' submissions for their MIDI software assignment. The class is buzzing with excitement as the students prepare to present their work.

PROFESSOR GIORDI
(smiling)
Welcome back, everyone! I'm excited to see what you've created with MIDI software and how you've incorporated the unconventional techniques we discussed last week. Let's begin with the presentations!

Several students present their projects, showcasing their DAW of choice, software synthesizers and samplers, MIDI utilities, and their application of unconventional MIDI techniques.

Finally, it's time for KATE, one of the students who decided to use MIDI mangling in her project, to present.

KATE
(nervously)
For my project, I decided to use MIDI mangling to create a unique and unpredictable composition. I began by recording a simple MIDI melody using a piano software instrument in Ableton Live.

KATE plays the original MIDI melody for the class. It's a pleasant, straightforward tune.

KATE
(continuing)
Next, I exported the MIDI data as a file and imported it into a hex editor. I randomly changed some of the hexadecimal values, altering the note pitches, durations, and velocities. After that, I re-imported the mangled MIDI data back into Ableton Live.

She plays the mangled MIDI melody, which now sounds chaotic, dissonant, and unexpected. The class listens with curiosity and surprise.

KATE
(continuing)
Finally, I decided to push the mangling even further. I used Max for Live to create a custom MIDI device that would randomly alter the pitch and velocity of the notes in real-time, adding an additional layer of unpredictability to the performance.

KATE demonstrates the real-time MIDI mangling, and the class is mesmerized by the shifting, evolving soundscape she has created.

Great work, Lee! Your creative use of MIDI feedback loops has resulted in a captivating and dynamic composition. You've demonstrated how seemingly undesirable MIDI behavior can be harnessed for artistic purposes.

Next, Raj steps up to present his submission.

RAJ
(enthusiastic)
In my project, I decided to explore the use of dummy clips in Ableton Live. I created an empty MIDI clip and added automation data to control various parameters on a software synthesizer. This allowed me to create intricate, evolving textures without triggering any actual MIDI notes.

Raj plays his project, and the class is treated to a constantly shifting soundscape, full of interesting modulations and evolving timbres, all controlled by the dummy clips.

PROFESSOR GIORDI
(impressed)
Excellent work, Raj! Your project highlights the power and flexibility of dummy clips for controlling and automating MIDI data. You've showcased an innovative approach to sound design and synthesis.

Finally, it's Clyde's turn to present his submission.

CLYDE
(nervous)
For my assignment, I decided to create a custom MIDI controller using Bome MIDI Translator Pro. I mapped various buttons, knobs, and sliders on my MIDI controller to control multiple parameters on different software instruments simultaneously. This allowed me to create complex, synchronized changes in my composition, adding depth and interaction to my performance.

Clyde demonstrates his custom MIDI controller, skillfully manipulating the various controls to create an engaging and dynamic performance that seamlessly blends multiple software instruments.
