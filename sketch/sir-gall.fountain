EXT. A MEDIEVAL PATHWAY - DAY

GIDEON, a young bard, walks along a dusty path, carrying a lute on his back. He appears to be muttering to himself.

GIDEON
"Oh, Gideon, my poor, foolish self. What was I thinking, becoming a bard in this day and age? In a world where swords and shields reign supreme, what use is there for a mere singer of songs and teller of tales?"

He stops and looks around.

GIDEON (CONT'D)
"No, instead I should have been born a blacksmith or a farmer, for those are the skills that people truly value. But no, I had to go and choose the path of the artist, the path of the dreamer and the romantic."

He sighs.

GIDEON (CONT'D)
"Perhaps I should take up arms and become a knight like Sir Gall, then people would finally take notice of me. Ha! Can you imagine it? Little old me, charging into battle with a sword in hand?"

He shakes his head.

GIDEON (CONT'D)
"No, I fear I shall have to content myself with the simple pleasures of music and poetry, and hope that one day, someone shall appreciate my talents. Until then, I shall sing and play and dream, and hope that the world shall be kind to this humble bard."

Gideon continues down the path, strumming a few chords on his lute as he goes.

FADE TO BLACK.
