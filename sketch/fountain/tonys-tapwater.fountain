FADE IN:

INT. KITCHEN - DAY

We see a group of people trying to make pizza in a kitchen. The dough is ready, the sauce is simmering, but something's missing.

PERSON 1
This doesn't taste like real New York pizza.

PERSON 2
Yeah, what's missing?

PERSON 3
I think it's the water. You can't make New York-style pizza without New York water.

Suddenly, the door bursts open and in walks TONY, the founder of Tony's Tapwater.

TONY
You guys need some help?

PERSON 1
Who are you?

TONY
I'm Tony; the founder of Tony's Tapwater, and I'm here to solve your New York pizza problem.

Tony pulls out a bottle of water.

TONY
This is Tony's Tapwater, straight from the taps of Brooklyn, New York. It's the secret ingredient that makes New York pizza taste so good.

PERSON 2
But we don't live in New York. How can we get this water?

TONY
That's where Tony's Tapwater comes in. We export Brooklyn tapwater so that you can try to mimic the taste of real New York pizza in your own city.

Tony pours some of the water on the slice of pizza. Person takes a bite.

TONY
That's because it is. And now, with Tony's Tapwater, you can make pizza that tastes just like it came straight out of a New York pizzeria.

A group of people are grilling hot dogs.

Man, these hot dogs need something.

They need that New York flavor.

I wish we had some of that Brooklyn tapwater.

Suddenly, Tony appears with a bottle of Tony's Tapwater.

TONY
Did somebody say Brooklyn tapwater?

Tony pours some of the water into the pot where the hot dogs are cooking.

EXT. NEW YORK CITY SUBWAY - DAY

The scene transitions to a New York City subway platform, with a dirty, graffiti-covered train roaring by, and the scent of garbage wafting through the air.

This is exactly what we needed.

TONY
Just wait until you try this.

Tony pours a splash of the water into the tub.

Did somebody say they needed help with a cocktail?

BARTENDER
Yes, actually.

Tony pours some of the water into the cocktail shaker, distinctly changing the color.

TONY
You're damn right it will. Tony's Tapwater, the secret ingredient to New York-style pizza, remember; if it doesnt have the label, it might not be from Brooklyn.
