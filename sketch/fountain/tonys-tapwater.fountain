FADE IN:

INT. KITCHEN - DAY

We see a group of people trying to make pizza in a kitchen. The dough is ready, the sauce is simmering, but something's missing.

PERSON 1
This doesn't taste like real New York pizza.

PERSON 2
Yeah, what's missing?

PERSON 3
I think it's the water. You can't make New York-style pizza without New York water.

Suddenly, the door bursts open and in walks TONY, the founder of Tony's Tapwater.

TONY
You guys need some help?

PERSON 1
Who are you?

TONY
I'm Tony, and I'm here to solve your New York pizza problem.

Tony pulls out a bottle of water.

TONY
This is Tony's Tapwater, straight from the taps of Brooklyn, New York. It's the secret ingredient that makes New York pizza taste so good.

PERSON 2
But we don't live in New York. How can we get this water?

TONY
That's where Tony's Tapwater comes in. We export Brooklyn tapwater so that you can try to mimic the taste of real New York pizza in your own city.

Tony pours some of the water on the slice of pizza. Person takes a bite.

PERSON 3
Wow, this water really does taste different.

TONY
That's because it is. And now, with Tony's Tapwater, you can make pizza that tastes just like it came straight out of a New York pizzeria.

FADE IN:

INT. KITCHEN - DAY

Tony is still holding the bottle of Tony's Tapwater as several people enter the room.

TONY
And it's not just for pizza. Tony's Tapwater is perfect for all your cooking needs.

CUT TO:

INT. BACKYARD BBQ - DAY

A group of people are grilling hot dogs.

MAN 1
Man, these hot dogs need something.

WOMAN 1
They need that New York flavor.

MAN 2
I wish we had some of that Brooklyn tapwater.

Suddenly, Tony appears with a bottle of Tony's Tapwater.

TONY
Did somebody say Brooklyn tapwater?

Tony pours some of the water into the pot where the hot dogs are cooking.

MAN 1
Wow, that smells just like New York!

WOMAN 1
I can already taste the difference.

MAN 2
This is exactly what we needed.

CUT TO:

INT. SPA - DAY

A woman is soaking in a tub of water.

WOMAN 2
Ah, this feels amazing. But something's missing.

Tony enters the room with a bottle of Tony's Tapwater.

TONY
Did somebody say something's missing?

The woman nods.

TONY
Just wait until you try this.

Tony pours a splash of the water into the tub.

WOMAN 2
Oh, that feels so refreshing.

TONY
That's the Brooklyn tapwater for you.

CUT TO:

INT. COCKTAIL BAR - DAY

A bartender is mixing drinks.

BARTENDER
I can't get this cocktail just right.

Tony enters the bar with a bottle of Tony's Tapwater.

TONY
Did somebody say they needed help with a cocktail?

BARTENDER
Yes, actually.

Tony pours some of the water into the cocktail shaker, distinctly changing the color.

BARTENDER
That's it. That's exactly what it needed.

TONY
I told you, Tony's Tapwater is perfect for all your cooking needs.

CUT TO:

INT. SAME KITCHEN AS BEFORE - DAY

PERSON 1
How do we order?

TONY
Just go to our website, tonystapwater.com, and place your order today. Or look for the label in your local specialty cooking store.

PERSON 2
This is going to change everything.

TONY
You're damn right it will. Tony's Tapwater, the secret ingredient to New York-style pizza, remember; if it doesnt have the label, it might not be from Brooklyn.

FADE OUT.
