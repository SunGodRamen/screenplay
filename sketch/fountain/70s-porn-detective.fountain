INT. BUCK'S OFFICE - DAY (ON A BOAT)

The office is located on a boat, filled with tropical plants, a few stacks of VHS tapes, and detective paraphernalia. A Hawaiian shirt hangs casually over the back of a chair. The gentle sound of waves lapping against the boat sets the scene. Cho enters hesitantly, looking around the room, trying to find Buck.

SYLVIA
(Confused)
Buck, are you in here?

As she speaks, Buck leans back in his chair, appearing from behind a tall stack of VHS tapes. He's wearing a Hawaiian shirt and sporting a thick mustache, reminiscent of Magnum P.I.

SYLVIA
(Handing Buck a file)
We've got a new case. Mysterious death of a wealthy businessman, Mr. Davis. Looks like foul play.

Buck takes the file and starts flipping through it, intrigued. He stands up quickly, but in the same monotone voice, he says:

BUCK
Let's ride, baby. Time to lay some pipe... of justice.

Buck and his team are outside the locked door of the morgue, attempting to investigate the mysterious death of Mr. Davis.

SYLVIA
Buck, they're not just going to let you into the morgue. There are rules.

BUCK
(poor acting)
There's no opening Buck can't unclog.

Cue mysterious bassline. Buck gives a knowing glance at the door.

CUT TO:

INT. MORGUE - DAY

The door bursts open as Buck enters, striking a pose.

BUCK
Did somebody order a... plumber?

The bassline dies down, and Buck approaches the body of Mr. Davis.

BUCK
(Examining the body)
I knew something was fishy. This man's been strangled. And he was a member of the Flushed Ones, a brutal prison gang of plumbers.

As Buck analyzes the body, his team gathers around him.

ANGIE
(Struggling with her clipboard)
How can you tell?

BUCK
There's a tiny tattoo of a wrench hidden under the bruising. It's like spotting a plumber's crack, you just have to know where to look.

FADE OUT:

INT. CONSTRUCTION SITE - DAY

Sylvia and Charlie arrive at the construction site where the plumbing problems occurred. They start questioning the workers about the plumbing issues and Mr. Davis's involvement in the project.

CHARLIE
So, you guys noticed any issues with the plumbing here?

WORKER
Yeah, there have been a few leaks and busted pipes. It's been a real mess.

SYLVIA
Were you doing anything about it?

WORKER
Sure, I called a plumber

BUCK reacts as if he is restraining himself

WORKER
Yeah those pipes were real leaky, they really needed some fast attention

BUCK is struggling to hold himself back, the baseline is softly starting to play.

SYLVIA
Easy Buck, sir could you please use less innuendo

WORKER
Oh, of course, I wouldn't want to offend, I was just talking about how we had to give those pipes a good... twist to get 'em flowin' again.

BUCK is gone when they look back.

CUT TO:
Buck driving a mustang down the California coast, the film now has distinct VHS static lines now, bass line in full blast.

INT. MR. DAVIS'S OFFICE - DAY

Charlie and Angie sift through documents and files in Mr. Davis's office, searching for clues about his business dealings. Buck busts in the door with a package.

BUCK
Where can I put this huge package, oh hey guys, who long was it this time?

CHARLIE
Buck, we need you to solve your '70s addiction, it's getting in the way of our cases. I swear, if you didn't always solve the case, I'd have to report you to the board.

ANGIE
Buck, look at this. Mr. Davis was working with a business partner, Mr. Johnson. It seems like Johnson was cutting corners on the plumbing to save money.

BUCK
(Holding up a blueprint)
And this blueprint here shows that the plumbing was not up to code. That could have caused some serious... backflow.

FADE OUT:

INT. CONSTRUCTION SITE - DAY (LATER)

Buck, Sylvia, Charlie, and Angie return to the construction site, confronting the worker from earlier, who is now acting more suspiciously than before.

BUCK
You, the worker we spoke to earlier. You knew Mr. Davis was a member of the Flushed Ones. You wanted to use his connections to stash your dirty money in the pipes, didn't you?

The worker looks nervous and tries to hide his arm, which has a wrench tattoo on it.

WORKER
(Nervous)
I-I don't know what you're talking about!

Buck swiftly grabs the worker's arm, revealing the wrench tattoo.

BUCK
You're one of them, aren't you? You used the Flushed Ones' knowledge of plumbing to stash your dirty money in the pipes, and you killed Mr. Davis to tie up loose ends.

CHARLIE
(To Angie)
How did he know that?

ANGIE
(Whispers)
Buck's a savant when it comes to plumbing, pizza delivery... well, really any sort of delivery.

As they're talking, Buck takes out a wrench and starts to fix a leaky pipe. As he does, a hidden compartment opens, revealing stacks of cash and incriminating evidence against the worker.

BUCK
(Smiling)
Looks like your little scheme just got plunged down the drain.

The team arrests the worker and walks away triumphantly, while Buck basks in the glory of his victory.

INT. BUCK'S OFFICE - NIGHT (ON A BOAT)

The office is dimly lit, with only a single lamp casting shadows on the walls. Buck sits in his chair, looking out at the ocean, deep in thought. The sound of waves lapping against the boat creates a serene atmosphere.

BUCK
(To himself)
You know, sometimes I wonder why I'm so different from everyone else. It's like I've got this gift for solving cases, but it's also a curse. My connection to the '70s and my uncanny understanding of deliveries and plumbing... they've made me who I am today.

He takes a swig from a bottle of whiskey and stares at the reflection of his mustache in the glass.

BUCK
(Continuing)
But with great power comes great responsibility. Sometimes I feel like I'm trapped in a never-ending loop of seedy motels, late-night pizza deliveries, and sweaty encounters with pipes that need fixing.

The camera pans out, the Who plays as we pan away from the boat. Buck's legacy as the greatest '70s-obsessed detective with a knack for plumbing and deliveries lives on.
