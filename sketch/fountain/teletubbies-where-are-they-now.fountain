Title: Teletubbies: Where Are They Now?

INT. PRESS CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

A room filled with REPORTERS, CAMERAMEN, and FANS. A large banner hangs on the wall: "Teletubbies: The Reunion." The TELETUBBIES -- TINKY WINKY, DIPSY, LAALAA, and PO -- sit at a long table on stage, looking much older and a bit worse for wear.

HOST
Welcome, everyone, to the Teletubbies Reunion Press Conference! After all these years, we finally have our beloved childhood friends back together. Let's catch up with them and see where life has taken them!

ANGLE ON TINKY WINKY

Tinky Winky (early 50s) wears a cheap suit, holding a flask in his hand.

HOST
Tinky Winky, let's start with you. What have you been up to since the show ended?

TINKY WINKY
(slurring words)
Well, I took a stab at reality TV, "Keeping Up with the Winkies." Had my 15 minutes of fame, you know? But then, it all went downhill. Now, I'm in used car sales.

ANGLE ON DIPSY

Dipsy (late 40s) looks like a failed rockstar, wearing sunglasses indoors and an old, faded band T-shirt.

HOST
And Dipsy, we heard you tried to become a rockstar. Tell us more about that!

DIPSY
Yeah, I was in a band called "Dipsy and the Tubbytones." We had a one-hit wonder, "Tubbycustard Nights." But then, creative differences tore us apart. Now I do birthday parties and bar mitzvahs.

ANGLE ON LAALAA

Laalaa (early 50s) is dressed in a tracksuit, desperately trying to cling onto her youth.

HOST
Laalaa, you ventured into the fitness world, didn't you?

LAALAA
Yes! I had a series of workout DVDs called "Laalaa's Luscious Legs." It was a hit for a while, but then people moved onto new trends. I'm now an influencer on TubbyTok.

ANGLE ON PO

Po (mid 40s) looks jaded, wearing a business suit and carrying a briefcase.

HOST
Finally, Po! We heard you took a more corporate route. How's that working out for you?

PO
I became an executive at Big Hug Productions. It was a great gig, but the stress got to me. Now I've found solace in the world of pyramid schemes. Have you heard of TubbyEssentials? It's life-changing!

The room erupts in QUESTIONS and FLASHBULBS. The Teletubbies squirm in their seats.

INT. BACKSTAGE - LATER

The Teletubbies huddle together, looking nostalgic and bittersweet.

TINKY WINKY
You know, guys, despite everything, I'm glad we're back together.

DIPSY
Yeah, we had some great times. It's just too bad we couldn't keep the magic going.

LAALAA
(tearing up)
Remember when we used to dance in the fields with the sun smiling down on us?

PO
Those were the days. But hey, at least we're all still here for each other.

They share a group hug, and the screen fades to black.
