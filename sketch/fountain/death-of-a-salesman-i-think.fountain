Title: Death of a Salesman, I Think

A TITLE SCREEN reads "DEATH OF A SALESMAN."

The DOOR OPENS from the FPOV of the person answering and a NERVOUS SALESMAN, with a briefcase and suit, is standing on the step.

NERVOUS SALESMAN
(looking around, speaking quickly)

Suddenly, the SALESMAN EXPLODES.

BLACKOUT
