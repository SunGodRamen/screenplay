INT. A ROOM - DAY

A refugee from Ukraine, the REPRESENTATIVE, enters the room and greets the audience.

REPRESENTATIVE
Hellos. I am here to tell you my story and could be convince yous.

The REPRESENTATIVE pauses, reflecting on something.

REPRESENTATIVE
So I hear that Steven Seagul is coming to my town and he is supposed to represent Russia. Ooo big problem, Russia is very bad now.

The REPRESENTATIVE shrugs and continues.

REPRESENTATIVE
So I am thinking to myself- who is this Steven?

The REPRESENTATIVE turns to the audience, looking for an answer.

REPRESENTATIVE
So I ask my cousin, Yergei, and he says he is from the movies, from America.

The REPRESENTATIVE nods and continues.

REPRESENTATIVE
So I go to the internets. My nephew, he is good with the internets, and I tell him to look for the Seag- the Steven Seagul.

The REPRESENTATIVE makes a gesture with their hands, trying to explain something.

REPRESENTATIVE
And he is like the what?

The REPRESENTATIVE shakes their head, trying to imitate their nephew's confusion.

REPRESENTATIVE
And I am like the Steven Seagul.

The REPRESENTATIVE laughs at the memory and continues.

REPRESENTATIVE
So we find the movies- and these movies, these movies they are so bad ass.

The REPRESENTATIVE pauses, looking serious.

REPRESENTATIVE
And I, I am a religious man, and "thank you God, thank you." But these fuckin movies, my God.

The REPRESENTATIVE shakes their head in disbelief.

REPRESENTATIVE
Steven Seagul, he is one bad ass mother fucker.
The REPRESENTATIVE continues, now more excited.

REPRESENTATIVE
So anyway, Steven Seagul, he comes to my town, and I think to myself, I must meet this man. Maybe he can convince me that Russia is not so bad.

The REPRESENTATIVE pauses, as if considering the possibility.

REPRESENTATIVE
So, I go to the event where he is speaking. And there he is, the man himself, the Steven Seagul.

The REPRESENTATIVE makes a gesture as if they're seeing Steven Seagal for the first time.

REPRESENTATIVE
He starts to talk about peace and love between our countries, and I am listening, but my eyes, my eyes are on his ponytail. It is so majestic, like a horse's tail.

REPRESENTATIVE
And he is even wearing the Hawaiian shirt, like he does in the movies.

REPRESENTATIVE
So, he starts speaking, and he talks about how we can bring peace through martial arts and Japanese culture. You think "oi, alexi, this is crazy", but you will listen, as I listened, and you will believe, as I believed.

REPRESENTATIVE
He says that if we open dojos and train together, we can create understanding and unity among people, and if we all wear Hawaiian shirts, we can spread joy and happiness.

The REPRESENTATIVE nods, as if agreeing with the idea.

REPRESENTATIVE
So, I decide to join him on his mission. I leave my town and start traveling the world with Steven Seagal, spreading the word of the Seagul.

REPRESENTATIVE
Now people start coming together, and they forget about their differences. They train together, laugh together, and wear the Hawaiian shirts together.

The REPRESENTATIVE pauses, looking emotional.
