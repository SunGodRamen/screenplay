INT. A ROOM - DAY

A refugee from Ukraine, the REPRESENTATIVE, enters the room and greets the audience.

REPRESENTATIVE
Hellos. I am here to tell you my story and could be convince yous.

The REPRESENTATIVE pauses, reflecting on something.

REPRESENTATIVE
So I hear that Steven Seagul is coming to my town and he is supposed to represent Russia. Ooo big problem, Russia is very bad now.

The REPRESENTATIVE shrugs and continues.

REPRESENTATIVE
So I am thinking to myself- who is this Steven?

The REPRESENTATIVE turns to the audience, looking for an answer.

REPRESENTATIVE
So I ask my cousin, Yergei, and he says he is from the movies, from America.

The REPRESENTATIVE nods and continues.

REPRESENTATIVE
So I go to the internets. My nephew, he is good with the internets, and I tell him to look for the Seag- the Steven Seagul.

The REPRESENTATIVE makes a gesture with their hands, trying to explain something.

REPRESENTATIVE
And he is like the what?

The REPRESENTATIVE shakes their head, trying to imitate their nephew's confusion.

REPRESENTATIVE
And I am like the Steven Seagul.

The REPRESENTATIVE laughs at the memory and continues.

REPRESENTATIVE
So we find the movies- and these movies, these movies they are so bad ass.

The REPRESENTATIVE pauses, looking serious.

REPRESENTATIVE
And I, I am a religious man, and "thank you God, thank you." But these fuckin movies, my God.

The REPRESENTATIVE shakes their head in disbelief.

REPRESENTATIVE
Steven Seagul, he is one bad ass mother fucker.
The REPRESENTATIVE continues, now more excited.

REPRESENTATIVE
So anyway, Steven Seagul, he comes to my town, and I think to myself, I must meet this man. Maybe he can convince me that Russia is not so bad.

The REPRESENTATIVE pauses, as if considering the possibility.

REPRESENTATIVE
So, I go to the event where he is speaking. And there he is, the man himself, the Steven Seagul.

The REPRESENTATIVE makes a gesture as if they're seeing Steven Seagal for the first time.

REPRESENTATIVE
He starts to talk about peace and love between our countries, and I am listening, but my eyes, my eyes are on his ponytail. It is so majestic, like a horse's tail.

The REPRESENTATIVE chuckles, remembering the moment.

REPRESENTATIVE
But I digress. So, Steven Seagul, he talks to us, and after he finishes, he does something unexpected.

The REPRESENTATIVE raises their eyebrows, building anticipation.

REPRESENTATIVE
He invites us to come and speak with him, one on one. I am nervous, but I go to him, and I tell him my story.

The REPRESENTATIVE pauses, reliving the conversation in their head.

REPRESENTATIVE
And you know what he says? He says, "Listen, my friend, I am not here to represent Russia. I am here to promote love and unity between our people."

The REPRESENTATIVE nods, impressed.

REPRESENTATIVE
And then, he does something even more amazing. He teaches me a move from his movies, a signature Steven Seagul move.

The REPRESENTATIVE demonstrates the move, trying to imitate Steven Seagal.

REPRESENTATIVE
And now, my friends, I have the power of Steven Seagul in me. And although I am not yet convinced about Russia, I am convinced that Steven Seagul is one bad ass mother fucker, who can bring hope even to a confused Ukrainian like me.
